The infusion pumps are not directly affected. However, the interrupted network communication might prevent certain features of the device from functioning properly. Specifically, an impacted device may be unable to receive infusion orders from EMR/PDMS systems, receive a drug library update, or communicate with DoseTrac. For more information, see the B. Braun Vulnerability Advisory. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should: i) Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet; ii) locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks; iii) when remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.
